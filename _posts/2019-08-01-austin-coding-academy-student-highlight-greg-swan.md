# Get to know Austin Coding Academy graduate Greg Swan

At Austin Coding Academy, we take pride in the success that our students and graduates achieve. Every month we look to highlight at least one of our graduates and let the world know about what they're doing in their new careers.

This month, we caught up with Austin Coding Academy graduate [Greg Swan](), who accepted a job as a Web Developer at Kinetic Theory in Austin after finishing our Full Stack Web Development Track in 2018. Greg now works as a Web Application Developer with OpenSymmetry. Here's what he had to say about his experience as an Austin Coding Academy student:

### How did Austin Coding Academy prepare you for the job market?

ACA prepared me for the job market the way a high school teacher prepares you for college; they gave me a solid foundation of knowledge, taught me what not to do, and consistently reminded me that there was a job out there for me if I was willing to put in the work.

### Did ACA help you on the job search?

Yes! Chris Lofton was a great a help as far as finding and landing my first job. He recommended me to so many employers, and was a big part of how I got my initial interview for my current position.

### Any advice for current or future ACA students?

[A portfolio](https://gcswan.github.io/Resume/) is helpful and can help you find a job, but I think it was also helpful to build one more website. **Also: the more you code, the better you get.**

### Share a fun fact about yourself.

I wake up in the middle of the night and eat ice cream.
