title: Student Grievance Policy
policy_paragraphs:
- It is the school’s policy to resolve student grievances by working directly
  with the student, instructor, and other students if affected. Students with
  grievances should initially contact their instructor and articulate their
  grievance in writing. The instructor will notify the Director of Academics
  of student grievance and attempt to resolve the grievance.
- Attempts to resolve the grievance will be documented in email by the
  instructor and copied to the Director of Academics. If the instructor and
  student are unable to resolve the grievance, the grievance will be escalated
  to the Director of Academics. The Director of Academics will review prior
  resolution documentation, identify student concerns, needs, desires, and
  attempt to resolve the grievance with the student. The Director of Academics
  will document this process in writing in a student report file.
- If the Director of Academics is unable to resolve the student grievance, the
  Director of Academics will convene a committee of 2 student peers, 2 other
  certified instructors, and the Director of Academics to resolve the student
  grievance. The committee will review articulated grievance and documented
  attempts to resolve and form a majority decision for grievance resolution
  and present to student for approval. The Director of Academics will document
  their resolution in the student report file.
