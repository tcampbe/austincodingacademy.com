- title: Tech’s Diversity Problem
  text: The current makeup of the tech industry fails to represent the cultural makeup and trends of Dallas, 
    Texas and the United States as a whole. Our world is becoming more diverse by the day, and as tech plays an increasingly important role in shaping it, the tech workforce should represent this shift. Circle Coding Academy is committed to a diverse and representative tech workforce for the future.

    smart homes and cars, to creating solutions to the biggest challenges we face in society. A tech workforce that truly represents how diverse we are, makes sure that all perspectives are considered in the solutions that we create.
