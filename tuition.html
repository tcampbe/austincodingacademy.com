      description: To provide a more flexible tuition option, we also offer a “pay-as-you-go”
        plan. Rather than paying for the entire cost of the program up front, you’re
        able to pay for each course when you take it, ($2,990/course).

  - title: Individual Classes &amp; Electives
    description: Have previous experience as a developer or just trying to learn a
      bit of coding? You’re welcome to take any of the individual courses from the
      Full Stack Web Development Track or one of our Elective seminars (coming soon).
      While individual courses won’t prepare you to land a job as a developer, you
      can still learn useful skills.
    options:
    - title: Individual Courses
      description: The cost of an Individual 8-week course with Austin Coding Academy
        is $2,990. While our Full Stack Web Development Track is designed to prepare
        students to become developers and help them find a job, individual courses
        may be appropriate for students who already have a coding background or aren’t
        looking for a career as a web developer.
